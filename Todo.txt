# Form components TODO

- Form submission
- How does reprovisioning look?
- API Congruency with Redux-Form

- initialState on Form, also allow configuring direct vs. buffered mode
  Maybe initialState is just something to put into Form, but not into Context
- Form level validation
- Async validation
- ArrayEditor

- Transformer need onChange callback that only fires when the modelvalue has changed
- ContextProvider should expose reset on context?
- Custom Equality function for Transformer for checking modelvalue Equality
- Path normalization for ContextProvider
- Make a new version of the makeField decorator
- Move Transformer into Context
